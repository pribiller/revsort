/*******************************************************
 * This class implements the algorithm described in 
 * Hannenhalli and Pevzner (1999) to transform unoriented 
 * components into oriented components with a minimum
 * number of reversals.
 * 
 * The idea consists of first sorting the unoriented components 
 * by their rightmost element, and then merge non-consecutive 
 * hurdles H_1 and H_2 by applying a reversal that affects a
 * gene in H_1 and a gene in H_2.
 * 
 * Once all components are oriented, they can be sorted
 * using, for example, the algorithm from Tannier et al. (2007). 
 * 
 * For more details on the algorithm to transform unoriented
 * connected components of the overlap graph into oriented ones, 
 * please check:
 * 
 * Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1999: "Transforming cabbage into 
 * turnip: polynomial algorithm for sorting signed 
 * permutations by reversals" (Lemma 18 and Lemma 19).
 * 
 * Haim Kaplan et al., 1997: "Faster and simpler algorithm for 
 * sorting signed permutations by reversals" (Lemma 5.1);
